# Technical Plan for a "MaryS" MonoGame-Based 2D Turn-Based Game Engine

## Overview and Project Structure

The goal of this project is to build a **user-friendly, turn-based focused 2D game engine** on C# MonoGame. The engine will allow developers (especially non-coders) to create turn-based games (and other 2D games) with minimal coding. To organize the project:

-   **Content Folder Layout:**
    
    -   **Desktop/** – Contains files that appear on the engine’s “desktop” UI (like a virtual OS desktop). This is the start screen with icons/files that can be opened in the engine.
        
    -   **Modules/** – Contains installable **editor modules** that extend engine functionality (e.g. Scene Editor, Top Bar, Side Bar, Asset Browser, Code Editor, etc.). The engine’s core loads these plugins at runtime[community.monogame.net](https://community.monogame.net/t/monogame-editor/8658#:~:text=source%2C%20community,MonoGame). Removing a module from this folder will disable its features in the editor.
        
    -   **Games/** – Contains game project folders. Each game project has its own folder with all its code, assets, and data. The engine can run these games within itself for testing, and games can be exported as standalone MonoGame projects.
        

This structure ensures a clear separation between the engine’s editor features (modules), the user’s desktop environment, and the actual game projects.

## Core Architecture and Module System

The core engine is using MonoGame for rendering and input. Key architectural considerations:

-   **MonoGame Game Loop Integration:** The engine itself runs on MonoGame’s game loop, which will not only render the editor UI (windows, desktop, etc.) but also can instantiate a game for preview/testing.
    
-   **Plugin/Module Architecture:** Follows a plugin-based design where the core engine is minimal and all tools are modular. Defines an interface or base class (e.g., `IGameEngineModule`) that modules implement. The engine will:
    
    -   Discover modules by scanning the **Modules/** folder (for DLLs or script files).
        
    -   Load each module dynamically (using reflection or a service locator) and call an initialization method.
        
    -   Provide each module with access to core services (rendering, input events, scene data, etc.).
        
    -   Example: A `SceneEditor` module might register a new window in the UI and hooks to engine events (like selection changed, object moved).
        
-   **Independence and Persistence:** Ensures that any game content or code created via a module remains in the game project even if the module is removed. For example, if a “Particle Editor” module was used to create a particle effect, the module should export that effect as C# code or data into the game’s folder. Later, if the module isn’t present, the game still has the necessary code/assets to function. In practice, modules will act as code generators or editors, but the output (C# scripts, content files) lives with the game. The engine could incorporate a code-generation system where editor actions (adding an object, setting up a UI) produce C# script files or data files in the project.
    
-   **Separation of Editor vs Game Runtime:** Architects the engine so that the **editor layer** (modules and GUI) is separate from the **game runtime layer**. The game projects could be compiled into assemblies that the engine loads for in-editor playtesting. This is similar to Unity’s approach where the editor runs the game in a sandbox. In MonoGame, one approach is to have the game project as a library and the editor creates an instance of the game. You might utilize a scripting runtime (like Roslyn to compile C# on the fly) or simply require building the game project and then loading the DLL. Ensuring a clear API between the editor and game helps maintain modularity.
    
-   **Data-Driven Design:** Favors data files (JSON, XML, or ScriptableObjects) for game configuration that the editor can manipulate, rather than complex code generation for every aspect. For instance, character stats, enemy definitions, tile maps, dialog scripts can all be in data files editable via custom editors. The engine can then generate or update code only for things that truly require it (like registering a new Scene class, etc.).
    

## Editor Modules and Tools

Includes a suite of core modules (tools) to cover all aspects of game development, focusing on turn-based game needs:

-   **Scene Editor:** A visual editor for game scenes (levels, maps, battle arenas, menus, etc.). It should allow placing and manipulating game objects (tiles, characters, interactive objects) on a canvas. Features to include:
    
    -   Grid snapping and tile-based placement (especially for tactics-style games).
        
    -   **Tilemap Editing** with autotiling – e.g., painting terrain with an autotile algorithm so edges and corners pick the correct tile variant automatically (like RPG Maker or StarCraft editors). This speeds up map design by choosing the right tile based on neighbors.
        
    -   Object placement and layering – allows adding entities (player start, enemies, items) to the scene with visual icons.
        
    -   Multi-layer support (background, collision layer, interactive layer, etc.).
        
    -   The Scene Editor should update the **Hierarchy/Scene Tree** and allows selecting objects to edit properties in the Inspector.
        
-   **Hierarchy Tree (Scene Graph):** A panel showing the structure of the current scene (and possibly the UI hierarchy). This is similar to Unity’s Hierarchy panel – it lists game objects, allowing selection, parent-child relationships, and ordering. For example, under a “BattleScene1” you might see child objects like “TileMap”, “Enemy Orc #1”, “PlayerCharacter”, etc. Selecting an item highlights it in the Scene view and shows its properties in the Inspector.
    
-   **Inspector (Properties Panel):** Shows detailed properties of the selected object or asset. This allows editing values without code. For instance, if a character sprite is selected, the Inspector could show coordinates, sprite image, stats (HP, attack, etc.), behaviors attached, etc. For a tilemap, it might show the tileset used and map size. The Inspector should handle different data types (numbers, text, booleans, dropdowns for enums, color pickers, etc.) and allow modules to extend it with custom property drawers. This is crucial for a user-friendly, **no-code** experience.
    
-   **Asset Browser:** A file explorer for game assets (sprites, sounds, scripts, etc.) possibly represented as icons or a tree. The Asset Browser should integrate with the **Desktop** folder metaphor – items placed on the “desktop” of the engine could just be shortcuts or representations of actual assets/projects. Key functions: import new assets (with drag-and-drop from OS), organize assets into folders, preview assets (thumbnail for images, waveform for audio, etc.). Double-clicking an asset might open it in a relevant editor (e.g., image editor, code editor, etc., if those modules exist).
    
-   **Code Editor:** Although we aim for low-code, having an integrated code editor is useful for advanced users or for reviewing the auto-generated code. This could be a simple text editor with syntax highlighting for C#. It doesn’t need to be as full-featured as VSCode, but basic find/replace, undo, line numbers, etc., are useful. Alternatively, provide easy integration to open the project in an external IDE for heavy coding, but allow quick edits inside the engine. (If developing the code editor module is too time-consuming, focusing on excellent external IDE integration might be acceptable initially.)
    
-   **Game Runner/Preview:** A module that allows the user to **play the game inside the engine**. This could appear as a window or a mode where the engine enters a play-mode. You can design it such that when “Run” is pressed, the engine compiles the current game project (if needed) and starts the game loop in a sub-window. The user can then interact with the game. Support features like pausing, restarting, and possibly live editing: for example, while the game is running, the developer could move an object in the Scene Editor and see the effect immediately in the running game – achieving a real-time editor tweak. (This is complex to do reliably but greatly speeds iteration). Unity’s play mode is a reference for this functionality.
    
-   **MarySue – AI Assistant Module:** This is the built-in AI helper that guides and assists the developer throughout development. The MarySue module will provide a chat interface (like an IDE assistant) where the developer can ask questions or give instructions in natural language. For example, the developer might ask, “How do I add a new turn-based combat scene?” or “Generate a dialog between two characters about finding a treasure.” The AI will then use its capabilities to either explain steps or actually perform actions if possible. More on the AI integration is below, but from a UI perspective, MarySue could appear as a chat panel (possibly tabbed or as a collapsible sidebar) with an avatar or mascot icon. It should feel like a friendly guide.
    
-   **Additional Modules (Top bar, Side bar, etc.):** Basic shell modules for the engine’s UI: a top menu bar (with File, Edit, Project, Help menus), side panels for specific contexts (like maybe a **Project Explorer** that shows all game files in a tree view, separate from the Asset Browser which might show only certain types). A **Toolbar** with common actions (save, undo/redo, play, pause) should be present. These can be implemented as modules or as core UI since they are fundamental.
    
-   **Undo/Redo System:** The editor will include a global undo/redo stack to allow reverting changes (moves, property edits, etc.). Each module should integrate with this system when performing actions (for instance, moving an object in Scene Editor pushes an undo-able transform change).
    
-   **Event Editor / Visual Scripting (for Logic):** To maximize the no-code approach, includes an **Event System** editor. This can be similar to GDevelop’s event sheet or Unreal’s Blueprints: a way to define game logic by selecting conditions and actions rather than writing code. For example: _Condition:_ “Enemy HP <= 0” then _Action:_ “Play death animation and remove enemy from scene.” These could be represented in a table or node graph. **Visual Scripting** for turn-based mechanics (like defining turn order, win/lose conditions, AI behavior for enemies) would empower non-programmers. GDevelop demonstrates how an event system can replace code for game logic, being “as efficient as coding, but without the complexities of a programming language”[gdevelop.io](https://gdevelop.io/#:~:text=What%20makes%20GDevelop%20unique%20and,complexities%20of%20a%20programming%20language). Initially, we might implement a simpler trigger system: e.g., in the editor, the user can specify that “on button X clicked, go to Scene Y” or “when turn ends, switch active player.” Under the hood, these could correspond to calling functions or changing states in the game code (which the engine generates).
    

## Supporting Turn-Based Game Structure

To cater specifically to turn-based games, the engine should provide built-in concepts and templates for common turn-based game structures:

-   **Predefined Scene Types:** As described, every scene can be categorized as one of a few types: **Menu**, **Base (hub area)**, **Dialogue** (cutscene or conversation), **Map** (exploration or world map), **Battle**. This encourages developers to structure their game flow in a known way. The engine’s new-scene dialog can let the user pick the type, and then use a template for that scene. For example:
    
    -   A **Menu scene** template might come with a basic UI (title and some menu options), which the user can then customize via the UI editor.
        
    -   A **Battle scene** template might include a turn order manager, a grid or tilemap ready to place units, and placeholder player/enemy objects to be configured.
        
    -   A **Dialogue scene** could open a specialized **Dialogue Editor** (possibly another module) where the user can script conversations or cutscenes (character poses, text lines, branching choices).
        
    
    Providing these templates jump-starts development by injecting code and assets relevant to that scene type. It’s essentially a scaffold: e.g., a battle scene could generate a C# class inheriting from `BattleScene` base class, with stubs for turn logic, so the user or AI can fill in specifics.
    
-   **State Machine for Game Flow:** Encourage a state machine approach for switching between these scenes (states). Turn-based games naturally flow through distinct phases (exploration, then combat, then back to exploration, etc.). We should implement a **Game State Manager** that controls active scenes. The developer (or the engine via visual triggers) will define transitions, e.g., “Start game -> go to Base scene; from Base -> Menu or Map; Map -> Battle on encounter; after Battle -> return to Map or Base; etc.” This formalism prevents a lot of spaghetti logic. It’s recommended in turn-based design to map out all game states and the triggers for changing states[idlethumbs.net](https://www.idlethumbs.net/forums/topic/10162-turn-based-strategies-basics-and-engine-choices/#:~:text=As%20for%20turn,games%20it%20is%20specially%20easy%2Fhelpful). Our engine can provide a graphical **State/Flow Chart editor** where the user connects scene nodes with transition triggers (like “win battle -> go to Victory Scene, lose battle -> Game Over Scene”). Underneath, this produces code or config for the state machine.
    
-   **Turn-Based Mechanics Support:** Includes libraries or modules for common turn-based game needs so the user doesn’t have to code them from scratch. For example:
    
    -   **Turn Manager:** A system to manage turn order, end-turn actions, and turn cycles. Possibly offer different modes (round-robin turns vs. initiative order vs. active time battle). The user can pick a mode or define custom turn progression via the event system.
        
    -   **Grid System:** Utilities for grid-based movement and range calculation if games use grid movement (like tactics games). E.g., a pathfinding helper for grid movement, highlight reachable tiles, etc.
        
    -   **Combat Resolver:** A simple module or set of templates for common combat calculations (attack hits, misses, damage, critical hits, status effects) to serve as examples. This could tie into a **Stats/Attributes System** where game entities have attributes (strength, defense, etc.) that the engine knows about. For a no-code setup, having a built-in stats/abilities editor is useful (so a developer can create “Attack” or “Heal” abilities and define their effects in a form/UI instead of code).
        
-   **Campaign and Level Management:** Provide structure for multi-level campaigns or missions. For example, a **Campaign Editor** that allows organizing multiple maps or battles into a sequence (with conditions for progression). This might include a world map or node graph of levels. The engine could generate a campaign file that lists all missions and their unlock criteria (e.g., mission 2 unlocks after mission 1 is completed, etc.). This keeps campaign logic easy to configure.
    
-   **Dialogue and Story Tools:** Turn-based games often have rich stories and dialogs (think JRPGs or strategy games with story). Implement a **Dialogue Editor** (could be a module) for creating conversations or cutscenes: a timeline of messages, speaker portraits, branching choices for player responses. This can output a dialog script file or cutscene code. The AI assistant could help here by generating dialog text given a prompt (more below). Also consider a **Quest Editor** for RPG-like quest definitions (objectives, rewards, etc.), which ties into campaign progression.
    
-   **UI Elements for Games:** Many turn-based games need common UI components (health bars, inventory screens, tactical maps). The engine should include a **UI Layout Editor** for designing in-game UI screens. This would work like a form designer: drag buttons, labels, images onto a canvas that represents a screen. There should be templates for common UI screens (e.g., character status panel, inventory window, combat HUD with turn order display). The UI system can be built on a simple immediate-mode or retained-mode GUI library; MonoGame doesn’t have one built-in, but you could integrate something like ImGui or develop a basic UI framework (buttons, panels, etc.) as indicated by community demand. Ensures UI scales with resolution (anchor points, relative positioning). This UI editor is itself an editor module editing the game’s UI data, which then is used by the game at runtime.
    
-   **Multiplayer Integration:** If the project wizard indicates multiplayer, include the necessary foundation:
    
    -   The engine could provide a **Networking module** or use an existing library (Lidgren, Photon, etc.) to handle multiplayer.
        
    -   For a server-client model, generate code for a basic server (if it’s a dedicated server scenario) and client connection logic. For peer-to-peer, set up discovery or direct connect stubs. The developer should choose the mode in the wizard (e.g. “No multiplayer”, “Hotseat (same device)”, “P2P online”, “Client-Server online”), and then the engine will include appropriate code and modules.
        
    -   Example: If “multiplayer with server” is chosen, the project template might include a `NetworkManager` class with methods to connect to server, sync turn data, etc., plus UI elements for login/rooms. If “hotseat” is chosen, maybe nothing special is needed except ensuring turn manager can switch control between players.
        
    -   The engine’s playtesting should allow testing multiplayer locally (perhaps by running multiple instances or simulating clients). This is a stretch goal; at minimum, provide the hooks for multiplayer so the user can implement or the AI can script the details.
        

## AI Integration (LLM-Powered Assistant)

One of the defining features of this engine is the integration of a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to act as an AI assistant (MarySue) for the developer and to generate game content. Key points for implementing this:

-   **AI Capabilities:**
    
    1.  **Guidance & Q/A:** The AI should serve as a knowledgeable tutor for using the engine. The developer can ask questions like “How do I create a new battle scene?” or “Why is my character sprite not showing?” and the AI (powered by an LLM) will answer based on its training and possibly documentation fed into it. This reduces the need to consult external docs.
        
    2.  **Code Generation & Editing:** The AI can generate C# code or scripts for the game project on request. For instance, the developer might say “Create a C# script for a turn-based combat system with health and damage.” The AI could produce a code snippet or even directly add a new file to the project. Similar to GitHub Copilot or Cursor IDE, it can speed up coding tasks. We must provide the LLM with context – likely the content of existing project code or a summary of it – so it can make informed changes. An approach is to let the AI assistant read certain files or an AST of the code. When the user asks for a feature, the AI could draft code and the engine then inserts it into the project (with user confirmation).
        
    3.  **Content Generation:** Use the AI to create game content such as story text, character dialogue, item descriptions, or even level layouts. For example, the developer can prompt: “Generate a quest description where the hero must save a village from goblins,” and the AI returns a nicely worded description or dialogue script. As noted in an AI game jam experiment, an LLM can generate story, NPC dialogs, quests, etc., forming the narrative backbone of a game.
        
    4.  **Asset Generation Support:** While image or sound generation might involve other AI models (like diffusion models for images), the AI assistant can still help by, say, generating SVG shapes or simple pixel art via code, or integrating with an external API for image generation if available. At least, it can fetch placeholder art or guide the user on how to create it. The focus, however, should be on text/code generation with LLMs.
        
-   **LLM Choice and Integration:** You can integrate an existing LLM via API (such as OpenAI’s GPT-4) or allow plugging in a local model (for offline use). Initially, using a service like OpenAI or Azure OpenAI is simplest (though it requires an API key). The engine’s AI module should be designed to be model-agnostic if possible (so different backends can be swapped). Start with a known powerful model (GPT-4) to ensure good results. This will require an internet connection or local server; if offline usage is a concern, consider smaller local models with libraries like `LLamaSharp` for .NET.
    
-   **Context and Function Calling:** To give the AI “internal infrastructure access,” implement a system where the AI can call certain engine functions or scripting API. OpenAI’s function calling feature is a model for this – essentially, you define a set of functions (like “createObject”, “setProperty”, “addComponent”) that the AI is allowed to call by outputting a JSON payload. The engine would parse the AI’s response and execute those functions. **Example:** The user says “AI, add an NPC named Bob with 100 HP at (10,5) in the current scene.” The AI could respond with a function call like `createObject{ type: "NPC", name: "Bob", HP: 100, position: (10,5) }`. The engine then creates that NPC in the scene. This turns natural language into concrete actions. It’s important to constrain what functions are exposed for safety (to prevent destructive actions beyond the user’s intent).
    
    Another simpler approach is that the AI only proposes changes (in text form or code diff) and the user applies them manually. However, leveraging function calls can streamline the experience by automating the editor via AI. This was demonstrated in the HuggingFace game jam, where GPT-4 was used to directly place tiles on a map by calling a function in code.
    
-   **AI UI/UX:** The assistant should feel integrated but not intrusive. Have a clear **AI Console or Chat Window**, possibly with a small toggle button (maybe an “AI” icon or a mascot character that when clicked, opens the chat). In that window, the user sees a conversation. Additional features:
    
    -   Option to apply AI suggestions: If the AI provides code, offer a button “Insert this code” which will add it to a new or existing file. If it provides an explanation, that’s just read-only.
        
    -   The AI might also proactively suggest help. For example, if the user is inactive or seems stuck (this is optional), the mascot could pop up and say “Need any help? Try asking me how to do X.” Careful not to annoy advanced users – this should be configurable.
        
    -   Allow the user to upload or include game context for the AI. For instance, if the user wants the AI to generate dialogue between two specific characters, the engine could feed the character bios or current story context into the prompt (with the user’s permission).
        
-   **Leveraging AI for Engine Improvement:** The AI could even help the user write custom modules or extend the engine. For instance, “Help me create a new module for a particle system.” It might not write a full module correctly, but it could outline the steps or generate sample code, which is beneficial for open extensibility.
    
-   **Documentation and Safety:** Internally, maintain prompts that embed some documentation/instructions so the AI has knowledge of the engine’s API and modules. (E.g., a system message to the LLM: “The user is developing a game in our engine. The engine has these modules… Here is how to create an object…”) This will guide it to give accurate answers. Also, implement safeguards: always review AI outputs before executing any function calls or inserting code. Perhaps run code generation in a sandbox or at least do a compile check after insertion. Keep version control (or an undo snapshot) before applying AI changes, so the user can revert if the AI does something undesirable.
    

## Project Wizard & Mascot Guidance (Initial UX)

Upon launching the engine or creating a new game, a **Mascot-guided Project Wizard** will help set up the project. This mascot is distinct from the free-form AI chat; it follows a scripted interactive dialogue to configure the project. Consider the following for this feature:

-   **Mascot Character:** Pick a friendly character (could be a cartoonish game developer persona or a fantasy character) as the face of the wizard. This gives a human touch and makes the onboarding less dry. The mascot can have a name and personality (but keep it professional enough to not annoy repeat users).
    
-   **Wizard Flow:** Through a series of questions, gather the key requirements and then generate the project scaffold. Example flow:
    
    1.  **Game Genre/Style:** “What type of turn-based game are you making?” – Options could correspond to presets (e.g., “Tactical RPG (like Fallout Tactics/X-COM)”, “JRPG style (like Final Fantasy)”, “Strategy Boardgame”, “Visual Novel with turn-based battles”, “Other 2D game”). This choice influences what modules or templates to include.
        
    2.  **Multiplayer:** “Will your game have multiplayer?” If yes, follow-up: “What style of multiplayer do you need?” – Options: “Hotseat (local turn sharing)”, “Online (peer-to-peer)”, “Online (server-client)”. Include appropriate networking support based on this.
        
    3.  **Key Features:** Ask about certain systems to include: “Do you want a campaign/story mode?”, “Use an inventory/crafting system?”, “Include procedural level generation?” etc. For each “Yes”, the wizard can add a module or stub code for that feature. (For example, if they want an inventory, include an Inventory module and a basic inventory UI template.)
        
    4.  **Project Naming and Setup:** Finally, ask for the project name, preferred resolution or platform settings, and create the project folder and files.
        
-   **Automated Template Generation:** Based on answers, the engine will:
    
    -   Create the new game directory under **Games/** with the given name.
        
    -   Copy in template files (C# solution, necessary references to MonoGame, etc.).
        
    -   Add code for chosen features: e.g., if a turn-based tactics preset was chosen, create default classes like `BattleScene`, `MapScene`, a base `Unit` class for characters, and possibly a dummy content (like a sample map and character sprite) so the game can run immediately.
        
    -   Enable relevant modules: e.g., if they chose “include dialog system”, ensure the Dialogue Editor module is activated; if they chose multiplayer, include the Networking module, etc.
        
-   **Post-wizard AI Kickstart:** After project creation, MarySue (the AI) can pop up and say “Your project is ready! I’ve created a basic game with a Main Menu and an empty battle scene. What shall we do next?” The developer can then ask the AI to further develop features, effectively handing off to the AI or manual editing from that point.
    
-   **Repeatability and Edit:** Allow the user to re-run parts of the wizard or change decisions. For example, if later they decide to add multiplayer, they should be able to invoke the multiplayer setup process (perhaps via a menu “Add Feature -> Multiplayer” which essentially triggers the wizard questions related to multiplayer and then integrates it).
    

## User Interface & UX Considerations for the Engine

Designing the UI/UX for a game engine (especially targeting low-code usability) is crucial. Here are guidelines and features to ensure a smooth experience:

-   **Familiar Desktop Metaphor:** The engine starts with a “desktop” view, which is already implemented (draggable windows, icons, etc.). Build on that familiarity: use recognizable icons (folder icons for directories, file icons for assets, etc.), and support common interactions (double-click to open, right-click context menus for actions like rename, delete, properties). This lowers the learning curve since users can treat it somewhat like a normal operating system desktop. Make sure the desktop can show shortcuts to important things like the current project’s main scenes or documentation.
    
-   **Consistent Windowing UI:** All module panels (Scene Editor, Inspector, Asset Browser, etc.) should have a uniform look and window controls (close, minimize, dock). If possible, support docking/splitting so users can arrange their workspace (e.g., drag the Scene Editor to dock it on the left, etc.). Unity and Unreal allow flexible layouts – consider a simpler approach initially (like a few preset layouts, or basic tiling). The windows are draggable now; adding docking might require a UI framework or a custom implementation, which can be iterated on. At minimum, ensure windows remember their last position/size and reopen accordingly for convenience.
    
-   **Visual Clarity and Theme:** Choose a clean, modern theme for the editor (perhaps a dark theme by default, which many developers prefer for reducing eye strain). Use color and icons functionally: for example, in the Hierarchy, use different icons for different object types (sprite, light, UI element, etc.). In the event/visual scripting editor, use colors for conditions vs. actions. Maintain a legible font and adequate spacing – avoid stuffing too much text or controls in one area. Keep each panel focused (short paragraphs of help text or labels to guide the user).
    
-   **WYSIWYG Editing:** Strive for “what you see is what you get.” In the Scene Editor or UI editor, the user should see an approximation of how it will look in-game. If they move a character sprite in the Scene Editor, that’s exactly where it will start in the game. If they design a HUD, it should appear as it would in the game’s resolution. Provide gizmos and guides (like outlines around selected objects, the ability to drag handles to scale/rotate if applicable, rulers or grids for alignment). This visual feedback makes design intuitive.
    
-   **Drag-and-Drop Everywhere:** Embrace drag-and-drop interactions to reduce reliance on menus: e.g., dragging an asset from the Asset Browser into the Scene Editor creates a new instance of that asset in the scene (like dragging a sprite image into the scene creates a Sprite GameObject there). Dragging a script onto an object in the scene could attach that script (if using a component model). Dragging a module file into the Modules folder could trigger the engine to prompt installation. These interactions make content creation feel natural.
    
-   **No-Code Workflow:** Ensure that for common tasks the user _never_ has to write code manually. This means providing UI for configuration and using sensible defaults. A few examples:
    
    -   To create a UI button that ends the player’s turn, the user could add a Button via the UI editor, then in an event editor simply link the button’s “OnClick” to a predefined action “End Turn” (provided by the Turn Manager). No code needed – behind the scenes, maybe that just calls a function in code, but the user doesn’t have to open the script.
        
    -   To define enemy behavior, maybe use a behavior tree editor or simple checkbox options (“Aggressive AI: Yes/No”) which the engine translates into an AI routine.
        
    -   To set up win/lose conditions for a battle, present a dialog of options (e.g., “Eliminate all enemies” or “Survive X turns”), which again the engine knows how to implement.
        
    
    These kinds of high-level tools, combined with ready-made logic pieces, make the engine approachable. (GDevelop, for example, provides “ready-made behaviors” that users can just apply to objects – we can do similar for things like “movable unit”, “player controller”, etc.)
    
-   **Help and Documentation:** Integrate help directly. For any active window or selected item, allow the user to press a help button or F1 to get context-specific help. This could be an HTML or Markdown file displayed in a window, or a link to online docs. Since we have an AI, the AI could also serve context help (“How do I use this tool?”). Ensure the mascot or AI hints at features not immediately obvious (e.g., “Try right-clicking on a sprite in the scene to see more options.”). Also provide example projects/templates that users can open to learn by example.
    
-   **Performance and Feedback:** The UI should remain responsive. Loading large assets or compiling code might take time – show a progress bar or spinner so the user knows the engine is working. If the user does something invalid (like tries to delete an in-use asset), show a clear error message explaining why it’s not allowed. Autosave the project periodically or prompt to save on risky actions, so user work isn’t lost.
    
-   **Undo/Redo UX:** As mentioned, a global undo is needed. This should be surfaced with familiar shortcuts (Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y) and perhaps a history window. It’s critical for experimentation – users feel free to try features if they know they can undo mistakes easily.
    
-   **User Customization:** Let the user configure certain aspects: keybinds (like play/pause game with a key), theme (if possible), default grid size, etc. At least store their layout and preferences between sessions.
    
-   **Testing and Iteration Ease:** Encourage a tight edit-test loop. Because turn-based games might have complex logic, providing tools like a **debug console** (maybe integrate something like a Quake-style console or at least an output log viewer) will help users track what’s happening during game runs. The AI could also assist by analyzing a log or debugging info if a user asks “why did X happen?”.
    

By focusing on these UI/UX aspects, we ensure the engine is not only powerful but also approachable, even for those with minimal coding experience. The combination of a familiar desktop paradigm, visual editors, templates, and AI assistance will make the development process more intuitive and enjoyable.

## Development Roadmap and Steps

Finally, here’s a high-level outline of steps to implement this project:

1.  **Foundation Setup:**
    
    -   Initialize a MonoGame project for the engine editor. Establish the game loop and basic rendering. Integrate a GUI framework or create a simple one for windows, buttons, etc. (Given that basic window dragging is done, ensure systems for input routing to UI vs. game view are in place).
        
    -   Set up the folder structure (Desktop, Modules, Games) on disk and ensure the engine can read from them. Perhaps create a startup routine that checks these folders and loads any existing modules or recent projects.
        
2.  **Core Module System:**
    
    -   Design the `IGameEngineModule` interface and module loading logic. Implement a Module Manager that scans **Modules/**, loads assemblies and instantiates modules. Handle versioning or dependency if modules rely on each other (the community suggestion was to allow module dependencies. For initial development, you can treat the main tools as built-in modules for simplicity.
        
    -   Create stub modules for each planned feature (SceneEditorModule, InspectorModule, AssetBrowserModule, etc.), and have them register dummy windows or menu entries to verify the module system works.
        
3.  **Editor UI & Windows:**
    
    -   Flesh out the GUI components needed: e.g., Window container, Panel, Button, TextField, List, TreeView, etc. (Leverage existing .NET or MonoGame.Extended UI libraries if possible to save time, or use ImGui.NET for a quick start).
        
    -   Implement the docking or layout management if possible, or at least a fixed layout where certain modules appear in certain areas by default.
        
    -   Add the top menu bar and common menus (New Project, Save, Run, etc.), wiring them to placeholder functions.
        
4.  **Project Creation Workflow:**
    
    -   Implement the New Project wizard (mascot dialog). This might be a sequence of dialog windows or a custom UI flow with the mascot graphic and questions. For now, script out the questions and outcomes (templates to include).
        
    -   Create template files for different presets (could use text files that are copied and with placeholders replaced, e.g., `%PROJECT_NAME%`). These include minimal code for a working game loop (MonoGame Game1 class or similar), and conditional inclusion of features (maybe maintain separate template sets like `Template_TacticalRPG.zip`, `Template_JRPG.zip`, etc.).
        
    -   After wizard, generate the folder and files in **Games/**, and load that project (i.e., set up references so the editor knows what project is open – maybe by loading a .csproj or a custom project file).
        
5.  **Scene Editor Implementation:**
    
    -   Develop the Scene Editor panel where the game world is drawn. This involves a camera to pan/zoom the view, the ability to draw grid lines, and rendering of game objects using MonoGame textures.
        
    -   Create basic object types the editor can manipulate: e.g., an Entity class with position, and subclasses or components for Sprite, Tilemap, etc. (For now, these can be simple placeholders just to visualize something).
        
    -   Implement selection and transform tools: clicking an object in the scene selects it (highlight it), dragging moves it. Possibly add gizmo for rotate/scale if needed (though for 2D tile-based, rotation might be rare).
        
    -   Integrate with the Hierarchy tree: the Hierarchy panel should reflect objects in the scene and allow selecting and maybe parenting (if hierarchy is used).
        
6.  **Inspector and Asset Browser:**
    
    -   Build the Inspector such that when an object or asset is selected, the panel populates with fields. You can use reflection or a manual approach: e.g., mark properties with attributes to show in inspector. For now, implement common fields like position (vector2), name, maybe sprite source (with a way to select an image asset).
        
    -   Asset Browser: implement listing files from the project’s asset directories. Thumbnails for images (you can generate these by loading textures at small size), text preview for scripts maybe. Support double-click (e.g., double-click image opens it in the default image editor module if exists, or just shows a larger preview; double-click sound plays it or opens audio editor, etc.).
        
    -   Drag-drop from Asset Browser to Scene Editor (create sprite object) and to other places (maybe drag an asset onto a property field in Inspector to assign it).
        
7.  **Content Editors (Tilemaps, etc.):**
    
    -   Develop a Tilemap Editor mode within the Scene Editor or as its own module. This should let the user select a tileset (a sprite sheet of tiles) and paint on a grid. Implement autotiling: typically by using bitmask algorithms or template rules (you might define a set of rules for transitions between tile types). This can get complex, so possibly integrate the open-source Tiled map editor’s file format: e.g., allow importing TMX files using libraries like MonoGame.Extended.Tiled or TiledCS (as referenced by the community) to handle a lot of this. In the long run, an integrated editor is nice; short term, supporting Tiled might be faster and later embed Tiled via module or replicate needed features.
        
    -   If writing our own, focus on making it easy to draw and erase tiles, fill areas, etc. Store the tilemap in a data structure that will be saved to the game (perhaps as a JSON or a custom binary format that the runtime can load).
        
8.  **Gameplay Systems and Visual Scripting:**
    
    -   Implement the core **Game State Manager** in the runtime (and expose it to the editor for state transitions). E.g., a simple finite state machine where each state corresponds to a Scene. In the editor, provide a UI to add states (scenes) and define transitions (triggers). You might start by hardcoding some triggers (like a function call `GameStateManager.SwitchState("BattleScene1")`), and use the visual editor later to generate code that calls these at appropriate times (like when a mission is completed).
        
    -   Build a basic **Turn Manager** class in the runtime and expose controls in the editor for it. For instance, in the Inspector for a BattleScene, show options for turn order (dropdown between “Round-robin” or “Speed-based”). The selection could configure the Turn Manager accordingly.
        
    -   Start developing a library of common **behaviors/components**: e.g., Health component (with HP, maybe Armor), Combatant component (flags an entity as participating in turn order), AI component (with a simple state machine or script for enemy AI). Make these accessible via the editor: possibly a “Add Component” button in the Inspector to attach behavior scripts to an object. This is moving towards an ECS (Entity-Component-System) or Unity-like component model, which is beneficial for flexibility.
        
    -   Visual Scripting / Event Editor: This is a significant feature. Initially, you can implement a simpler **Trigger-Action** system: in a friendly UI, allow user to pick an event (like “On Collision” or “On Button Click” or a custom event like “On Turn End”) and then pick an action (“Load Scene”, “Play Animation”, “Change Variable”, etc.). These can be represented as rows or nodes. Under the hood, these can be translated to C# event subscriptions or method calls in a generated script. For example, selecting “On Button X Click -> Switch to Scene Y” would result in code added to the MenuScene class: `buttonX.OnClick += () => GameStateManager.SwitchState("Y");`. The user doesn’t see the code unless they open it, but it’s there.
        
    -   Keep expanding the event/visual scripting system with more condition types and actions as needed for turn-based logic (like “if enemy count = 0 then victory”).
        
9.  **Multiplayer Framework:**
    
    -   Choose a networking approach suitable for MonoGame (Lidgren is a good UDP library; or even a simple TCP for starters). Implement a NetworkManager service in the engine runtime that can handle connections. Provide a thin abstraction so that whether it’s P2P or client-server, the game code calls something like `NetworkManager.SendMove(unitId, targetTile)` and the details are handled.
        
    -   Generate code for multiplayer if chosen: e.g., include a NetworkManager class and if server-client, perhaps a separate console app project or instructions to run a server (though building a full server interface might be out of scope initially). At least ensure that the game can act as host or client for P2P: MonoGame can open a socket after all.
        
    -   In the editor, provide UI to test multiplayer. Maybe allow launching a second instance easily or simulate two players by alternating control (hotseat). For now, focus on the structure, as fully testing online features might require infrastructure beyond the engine itself.
        
10.  **LLM Integration Development:**
   -   Start by integrating a known API (like OpenAI). Write a helper in the engine to send a prompt and get a response. Create the MarySue UI panel for chat. Test simple queries (hard-code some engine info in the prompt so it can answer basic questions).
        
   -   Gradually wire up more context: e.g., if the user has a script open, send its content as part of the prompt for “help me debug this function.” If user is asking about a specific object in scene, you could include that object’s properties or the context of the question.
        
   -   Implement function-call abilities: define a set of JSON-based function specs for things the AI can do (create object, modify property, etc.). When a response from AI indicates a function call, handle it by executing the corresponding action in the editor. Example: user says “Add an Orc enemy at (5,5) on the map,” the AI could respond with a `CreateEntity` function call payload; the engine then actually creates that entity in the scene. This is a complex but game-changing feature, so carefully test with various prompts.
        
   -   Provide the AI with the engine’s API documentation (perhaps as system prompt content) so it knows the correct classes and functions to use when generating code or function calls.
        
   -   **Testing AI**: Do iterative testing with the AI: ask it to do known tasks and see if the outcome is correct. You might need to tune the prompts or add few-shot examples (demonstrations in the prompt of how to respond). For now, keep the scope limited (maybe start with Q&A and code generation, then add direct action later).
        
11.  **Polish UI/UX & Iterate:**
    
   -   At this stage, start refining the UI: improve visual designs (icons, maybe hire or use open-source icons for tools like move, rotate, play, save). Ensure layout is nice on different screen resolutions.
        
   -   Add convenience features: a recent projects list on startup, a “tips” section or interactive tutorial that highlights each panel the first time (could be the mascot doing a guided tour).
        
   -   Gather some feedback (if possible) by having a few users try the engine to identify pain points. Use the AI to collect feedback (“Are you finding what you need?”).
        
12.  **Documentation & Samples:**
    
   -   Write documentation for using the engine and all modules. This will also help refine the design. Additionally, prepare a sample project or two (maybe a simple turn-based game and a simple platformer to show versatility). These serve both as tests and learning material for users.
        
   -   Integrate that documentation into the AI knowledge base or in a Help menu.
        
13.  **Final Steps:**
    
   -   Rigorous testing of module removal: ensure that if a module is deleted from the Modules folder, the engine disables its UI gracefully and does not break other parts. The content created with it should still run in the game. For example, if the ParticleEditor module is removed, the game’s particle systems should still function (meaning the runtime support for particles must be either generated into the game code or provided by some runtime library that stays). This might involve packaging some runtime libraries with the game project on creation.
        
   -   Performance profiling: optimize the editor rendering (large scenes should still be navigable), make sure memory is handled (unload unused assets, etc.). The engine might need to manage content loading separate for editor and game to avoid conflicts (MonoGame ContentManager could be used with different ContentManager instances for editor assets vs game assets).
        
   -   Finish up by implementing any missing features that are important for turn-based games (for example, save/load system for game state, if that’s something commonly needed; or polish the combat simulation tools).
        
Throughout development, we should maintain modularity and document the architecture. This will make it easier for others (or future you) to create new modules, or for open-source contributions if you go that route (the community interest in a plugin-based MonoGame editor suggests potential collaborators). The end result should be a comprehensive game engine/editor tailored for turn-based 2D games, with the flexibility to handle other 2D projects, empowered by AI assistance and a user-friendly interface.
